# JediSwap

Clone of Uniswap V2 to Cairo. AMM for StarkNet.

## Testing and Development

We use [Starknet Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/starknet-foundry) for our testing and development purposes. 
Starknet Foundry is a StarkNet smart contract development toolchain, which helps you with dependencies management, compiling and testing cairo contracts.
